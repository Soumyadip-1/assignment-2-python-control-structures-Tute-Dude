### Task 1: Even or Odd Checker
This program asks the user to enter a number and then tells them whether it is even or odd.

How it works:
- The user enters a number.
- The program checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo (`%`) operator.
- It then prints whether the number is even or odd.

### Task 2: Sum from 1 to 50
This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

How it works:
- A variable is initialized to store the total sum.
- The program loops from 1 to 50 and adds each number to the total.
- Finally, it prints the sum.
