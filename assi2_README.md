### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- **Description**:  
  This Python program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is **even or odd** using an `if-else` statement.
- **How it works**:
  - Takes input from the user.
  - Uses `%` (modulo) operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.
  - Prints the result.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- **Description**:  
  This Python program calculates the **sum of integers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.
- **How it works**:
  - Initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
  - Iterates from 1 to 50 using `range()`.
  - Adds each number to the sum.
  - Prints the total sum at the end.
